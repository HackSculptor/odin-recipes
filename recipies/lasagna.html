        SIMPLE MACRONI RECIPE
    </h1>

        How to Make Macaroni and Cheese on the Stovetop
        Step 1: Boil Macaroni
        Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about 8 minutes.
        
        Tip: For a thicker mac and cheese, double the amount of macaroni.
        
        Step 2: Make a Roux
        While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux. A roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese.
        
        To make the roux, start by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth. Slowly pour in milk and stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling. Be careful to not let the milk burn.
        
        Step 3: Add Cheese and Macaroni
        Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese! Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until smooth and melted. We recommend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block cheese.
        
        Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated.
        
        Can You Bake This Mac and Cheese?
        This stovetop mac and cheese is all about convenience, but if you find yourself with some extra time and a desire for bubbly, baked mac and cheese, you can bake this recipe.
        
        To do so, complete the first three steps above, then top with any desired toppings such as bread crumbs, Parmesan, crushed crackers, etc. Bake at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) for about 15 minutes, or until golden-brown and bubbling.
        
        How to Store Mac and Cheese
        Refrigerate leftover mac and cheese in an airtight container for three to four days. To reheat, stir in a splash of milk or cream and reheat in the microwave or on the stove, stirring periodically.
        
        You can freeze mac and cheese for up to six months. Allow the mac and cheese to cool completely, then transfer to a freezer-safe bag, removing as much air as possible. Label with the date and freeze. When you're ready to serve, simply transfer the dish to the fridge to thaw overnight. Reheat as normal.
        
        Mac and Cheese Add-Ins
        This is a great starter recipe that allows for endless customizations. Here are some add-in suggestions from Allrecipes reviewers:
        
        "I added onion powder, Parmesan cheese and a little bit of cayenne pepper," says RRL.
        
        "I always recommend using different cheeses for taste. I use white cheddar and four cheese Mexican blend together," says Angel.
        
        "I like to add diced ham and peas or diced chicken and broccoli…" says Fred Cannon.
        
        "I added yellow mustard and topped with crushed Ritz crackers," says Memmere.
